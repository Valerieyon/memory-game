## Udacity Project 2
My second Project on Udacity.

### Installation
1. Download the zip file or clone the repo from github.
2. Open the "index.html" file on browser window.

### Instructions
1. Click on 2 cards to form a pair.
2. Onced the all 8 pairs are formed, the game is finished and a popup screen will show the score (time, moves and rating).
3. To play again, click "Play Again!" in the popup screen.
4. Try to finish all the matching with the least moves and shortest time!

### Star Rating
- 3 Stars = less than 15 steps
- 2 stars = less than 19 steps
- 1 star = less than 23 steps
- 0 star = more than 27 steps

### Feedback
This is a very fun project to play with. Making the modal took me the longest time because it was a bit unclear at first how to hide the modal when the game is not finished.
